                                <p>Towards mid-day, when the weather was fine, he went forth and took a stroll in the
                                    country or in town, often entering lowly dwellings. He was seen walking alone,
                                    buried in his own thoughts, his eyes cast down, supporting himself on his long cane,
                                    clad in his wadded purple garment of silk, which was very warm, wearing purple
                                    stockings inside his coarse shoes, and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three
                                    golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points.</p>

                                <p>It was a perfect festival wherever he appeared. One would have said that his presence
                                    had something warming and luminous about it. The children and the old people came
                                    out to the doorsteps for the Bishop as for the sun. He bestowed his blessing, and
                                    they blessed him. They pointed out his house to any one who was in need of anything.

                                    mothers. He visited the poor so long as he had any money; when he no longer had any,
                                    he visited the rich.As he made his cassocks last a long while, and did not wish to
                                    have it noticed, he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak. This
                                    inconvenienced him somewhat in summer.</p>

                                    overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the

                                    difficulty in recognizing her. She looked him straight in the face, then walked

                                <p>I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this
                                    sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye.
                                    During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not
                                    in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few
                                    minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.

                                <p>But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course
                                    of Adèle’s studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the
                                    neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester’s chamber, Mrs.Fairfax’s voice, and Leah’s, and the
                                    cook’s﻿—that is, John’s wife﻿—and even John’s own gruff tones. There were
                                    exclamations of “What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!” “It is always
                                    dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.”</p>

                                <p>“How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!” “I wonder
                                    he waked nobody!” “It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the
                                    library sofa,” etc.
                                    To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when
                                    I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that
                                    all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings.

                                    remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that
                                    time Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of
                                    clear water that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous,
                                    like prehistoric eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in

                                    display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A heavy gypsy with an untamed

                                    demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the learned alchemists
                                    of Macedonia. </p>

                                    from the desperation of nails and screws trying to emerge, and even objects that had
                                    been lost for a long time appeared from where they had been searched for most and
                                    went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind Melquíades’ magical irons.</p>

                                    immediately after leaving Natasha’s room. He scoured the town in search of Anatole
                                    Kuragin. At the very thought of this man the blood rushed to his heart and he could
                                    hardly
                                    breathe. He was nowhere to be found, not on the ice-hills, not at the gypsies’, not

                                    Comoneno’s. Pierre drove to the club. In there it was just like any normal day with
                                    members coming in for dinner and sitting around in groups. </p>

                                    and habits greeted him, and said several things: a place had been left for him in

                                    dining-room, Prince Mikhail Zakharych was in the library, and Pavel Timofeich had

                                    he’d heard about Kuragin’s abduction of young Countess Rostov, which was the talk of
                                    the town, but was it true? Pierre laughed it off as a bit of nonsense, having just
                                    come from the
                                    Rostovs’. He asked after Anatole; one man said he wasn’t in yet, another said he was
